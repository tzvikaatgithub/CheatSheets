# support offerings for Microsoft 365 services

## Intro

This section talks about:
    
    * service level agreements (SLAs) concepts.
    * what support offerings available for Microsoft 365 and how to create a support request.
    * how to track the service health status by using the Microsoft 365 dashboard.
    * how organizations can provide feedback on Microsoft 365 services.

## Support options

THere are community based, web, chat, email, phone, pre-sales, and proactive support (recovery assistant and microsoft support). As well as a Partner support.

find Support in your microsoft account and open a request.

## SLAs

You have Microsoft Online Services Agreement, as well as SLA from the Cloud Service Provider. The latter depends on the provider.

You can receive service credits if you apply for them (admin has to apply).

Your organization should always review all Service Level Agreements and ask questions, including the following list:

    * If you're using a Cloud Service Provider, how does it determine service levels and whether they're achieved or not?
    * Who is responsible for reports? How can your organization access reports?
    * Are there any exceptions in the agreement?
    * What does the agreement say about both unexpected and scheduled maintenance?
    * What does the agreement say about what happens if your infrastructure goes down because of an attack? What about natural disasters and other situations outside of your control?
    * Does the agreement cover non-Microsoft service or system failures?
    * What are the limits to the cloud service provider’s liability in the agreement?

## Service Health Status

In Microsoft 365 admin, see Health > Service health.

You can view service health and report an issue from there.

There is an option to connect monitoring tools via API.

## Share Feedback

Different ways to submit feedback:

    Feedback
    In-product experiences
    Windows Feedback Hub
    Microsoft Tech Community
    Microsoft Store
    UserVoice forums

# Service Life Cycle in Microsoft 365

## Product Lifecycle

A product or service lifecycle typically has three phases:
    * Private preview
    * Public preview
    * General availability (GA)

## Modern Lifecycle Policy

Products are serviced and supported as long as:
    * Customers stay current as per the servicing and system requirements published for the product or service. Stay current means that customers accept and apply all servicing updates for their products and services.
    * Customers must be licensed to use the product or service.
    * Microsoft must currently offer support for the product or service.

There's a minimum of 12 months notice before ending support for products.

## Microsoft 365 Roadmap portal

This is where you can learn about the upcoming features and their status.

[Microsoft 365 Roadmap - Latest Updates | Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1&filters=)

The following list describes what the Microsoft 365 Roadmap allows you to do:

    * Search by product, keyword or feature ID.
    * Filter by product, release phase, cloud instance, platform, or new or updated.
    * Sort by general availability date or newest to oldest.
    * Download the current features in development as a CSV file.
    * View additional information about each update.
    * Use the RSS feed to be notified of feature updates in real-time.
    * Share an entire roadmap page or email a single feature.

# Security And Compliance Concepts

* shared responsibility and the defense-in-depth security Models
* zero-trust
* encryption and hashing
* basic compliance

## Shared Responsibility

Cloud based organizations share security responsibility with the vendor.

* IaaS - vendor is responsible for the physical components, network, physical security of the datacenter. Customer is responsible for software such as the operating system, network controls, apps, and data.
* PaaS - vendor is responsible for building, testing, and deploying software applications - hardware and the OS. Customer is responsible for apps and data.
* SaaS - vendor licenses the software to the customer, and is responsible for everything that the customer not responsible for. Customer is only responsible for the data, devices, accounts, and identities.

## Defense in Depth

DiD is a layered approach to security.

Examples:
    * Physical security such as limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel.
    * Identity and access security controls, such as multifactor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
    * Perimeter security of your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
    * Network security, such as network segmentation and network access controls, to limit communication between resources.
    * Compute layer security such as securing access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
    * Application layer security to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
    * Data layer security including controls to manage access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data.

## Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - CIA



    * Confidentiality refers to the need to keep confidential sensitive data such as customer information, passwords, or financial data. You can encrypt data to keep it confidential, but then you also need to keep the encryption keys confidential. Confidentiality is the most visible part of security; we can clearly see need for sensitive data, keys, passwords, and other secrets to be kept confidential.
    * Integrity refers to keeping data or messages correct. When you send an email message, you want to be sure that the message received is the same as the message you sent. When you store data in a database, you want to be sure that the data you retrieve is the same as the data you stored. Encrypting data keeps it confidential, but you must then be able to decrypt it so that it's the same as before it was encrypted. Integrity is about having confidence that data hasn't been tampered with or altered.
    * Availability refers to making data available to those who need it, when they need it. It's important to the organization to keep customer data secure, but at the same time it must also be available to employees who deal with customers. While it might be more secure to store the data in an encrypted format, employees need access to decrypted data.

## Zero Trust Model

Zero Trust assumes everything is on an open and untrusted network, even resources behind the firewalls of the corporate network. The Zero Trust model operates on the principle of “trust no one, verify everything.”

Attackers’ ability to bypass conventional access controls is ending any illusion that traditional security strategies are sufficient. By no longer trusting the integrity of the corporate network, security is strengthened.

In practice, this means that we no longer assume that a password is sufficient to validate a user but add multi-factor authentication to provide additional checks. Instead of granting access to all devices on the corporate network, users are allowed access only to the specific applications or data that they need.

Zero Trust guiding principles

The Zero Trust model has three principles which guide and underpin how security is implemented. These are: verify explicitly, least privilege access, and assume breach.

    Verify explicitly. Always authenticate and authorize based on the available data points, including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
    Least privileged access. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
    Assume breach. Segment access by network, user, devices, and application. Use encryption to protect data, and use analytics to get visibility, detect threats, and improve your security.

Six foundational pillars of Zero Trust:

    Identities may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles.
    Devices create a large attack surface as data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud. Monitoring devices for health and compliance is an important aspect of security.
    Applications are the way that data is consumed. This includes discovering all applications being used, sometimes called Shadow IT because not all applications are managed centrally. This pillar also includes managing permissions and access.
    Data should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls.
    Infrastructure, whether on-premises or cloud based, represents a threat vector. To improve security, you assess for version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. This allows you to automatically block or flag risky behavior and take protective actions.
    Networks should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.

## Encryption and Hashing

Encryption can be done on data at rest, in transit, and in use (in CPU/RAM caches).

Hashes are unique, fixed length values. Hashing is used to store passwords or verify authenticity of data. Salt is often added.

## Compliance Concepts

Regulations govern local laws applicable to data collected, processed, and stored.
