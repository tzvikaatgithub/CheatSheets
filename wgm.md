## Emotional Connection

When the other person is on an emotional height:
    * an upset person can't hear anything until they are calm
    * just listen, non-defensively
    * Become a journalist, find out about it from the person
    * understand
    * validate
    * DO NOT provide solutions
    * emphathise

## 3 Emotions - Become a Man Women Want

Make the person FEEL.

### Safety

Show you are not a threat. Mediocre looks are an advantage.

### Special

Show how the other person is special and unique. Appreciate something special.

### Desired

Looking good is hard. Notice it. Show you want it.

Show you are not needy. Show taste, show you are selective.

And walk away.


## 3 Buyer Mindsets

Only 1% of people do this.

### Pay Fair Price

Check the product out, don't be sold on it right away. Find out more first, see if its the right fit.

Don't be desperate. Don't be in a rush. Get enough info first, before you try something.

This attitude makes you a challenge, the other person will want to prove you their value.

### Trust Your Instincts

Maintain strong eye contact, have open body language, etc.

Don't try to follow a mental checklist and do the right thing. If you have a checklist, your fear of mistake will come as self conciousness. You should ride on your instincts, not a checklist. Instincts are developed in training. But riding on the instincts is what will do it in action.

You need this self-trust, as that is what makes you look confident and honest.

### Abundance Mentality

Scarcity mindset is when you feel you don't have a lot of options. Like one person is accessible or showed interest.

It's the mindset that costs him the options.

Explore your options. You will see there will be many good people interested in exploring a relationship with you.

## 13 Secret Things

1. don't worry, I got this.
2. open doors.
3. fix/improve stuff for someone on your own.
4. cook for someone
5. compliment something someone controls, or put effort into:
    * taste
    * though
    * smell
    * humour
6. put jacket/coat over when it's cold
7. forehead neshikot
8. give gifts - unexpectedly. Content doesn't matter.
9. just say "ani ohev otach"
10. lots of "metzachek lifnei"
11. looks don't matter, however, dress and groom, present yourself - shows responsibility and respect.
12. say "No" - show you have character and opinions - conveys confidence

## 5 Ways to Double Your Charm

### Own Your Flaws

Being at peace with yourself shows confidence and strength of character.

Think of yourself as worthy and lovable.

Your flaws don't matter unless you feel insecure about it. Be secure.

Exercise:
    * Make a list of what you think are your flaws.
    * Add how you can fix that.
    * Every day thank for the things you can't change. Fake it til you make it.
    * Repeat many times until solidified.

### Raise Your Enthusiasm

Be more enthusiastic, because most people live a very mundane life. They are desperately looking for excitement.

When you talk enthusiastically, you give them this feeling. Who wouldn't want it?

### Be Decisive

Make decisions. It signals authority, leadership.

Indecision shows lack of leadership.

When a decision can be made, pick something and make a call first, without waiting long.

Reason you overthink: Fear. Of failure, rejection or what not.

Reduce fear by thinking "will this decision even matter in a year from now"?

View decisions as fun little bets. Do the minimal due diligence and shoot from the hip (from your gut).

### Be The Mingler

It is a little advance for those who are just starting.

In any group setting you need to introduce yourself to and engage with as many people as you can. The quality of the interaction doesn't matter.

Talk for a minute or two to a lot of people. Take breaks. Push yourself a bit each time. Go recharge and come back.

People who see you doing this assume you are:
    * confident
    * popular
    * have high social status
    * valuable
    * leader

Introverts or shy people can do it too.

### Be Playful

This is at the heart of attraction. Don't take things too seriously.

People instinctively like a person who has a sense of humour. It is as big as confidence.

Someone who can make you smile, it just draws people magnetically.

It shows creative intelligence and charisma.

Don't try to impress someone, try to make the interaction more fun.

You don't need to be a comedian. Whatever you find it amusing and funny (and not offensive).


## 3 Secrets That Attract All

Make Her Feel Special

Be fully present in the moment. Undivided attention. Find out what makes the woman unique.

### Active Listening

This is really common, the guy is just waiting for an opportunity to talk.

He'd only ask questions and wait for the opportunity to say something about it.

Nod your head.

Tactics:
    * Say "I see", or "tell me more".
    * Repeat what she said in another words
    * add a comment about it
    * compliment

### Ask Deeper Questions

Show you've been listening. It also shows genuine interest.

Don't talk immediately about what you want to say. First explore more about what the other person talked about.

Use open ended questions, starting with "how, who, when, what, etc"

### Eye Contact

It allows the other person to feel that you are present.

Looking away a lot breaks the connection.

Don't stare the person down.

If the person is sharing something important to them, the more eye contact the better.

People look away because they are nervous.

## First Impression - 5 Things People Notice About You

### The Presentation

Natural looks don't matter. Presentation matters.

Well groomed, with closing that fits well makes the right impression. Most men don't.

Someone who puts time and effort into the presentation tells people that he respects himself, believes in his value, is mature.

Shower and smell good. Do exercise, stay fit.

### Non-Verbal Behaviour

Body Language, voice tone, facial expression.

Open, expansive, straight posture, relaxed shoulders.

Low, louder, resonant voice. He is not afraid of attention.

Eye Contact.

### Interaction With Others

Shows kindness to waiters, older, kids etc. Shows how you will treat people.

### How Others React

How other people react to you shows social proof.

If people around you find you fun, and are comfortable with you, perhaps they follow your lead. This all shows you are the leader, a good person.

### How You React To Her

Do you look away? Afraid?

Do you look casually, not interested?

Do you look confident? If yes, how will you react in the first few (1-3) minutes of the conversation. You'll want to lead the interaction.

Any challenges in the first 1-3 minutes are to screen.

## Great Questions
    1. ask about favourite secret behaviour

stop being "nice". create harmless tension.

playful teasing. more masculine. lighthearted. confident. not afraid to loose.

make fun (non-hurtful). good hearted tension.

banter: two-way teasing. witty exchange.

silly challenge. thumb war.

"nice guys" don't have an attractive spark.

## Ten Minutes A day

1. Pick 10 minutes a day. Try to do it consistently.
2. Announce this time, label it.
3. Give undivided attention. Do whatever she wants. Hold, hang picture. Whatever.

For her and about her. For connecting. For making feel special. Create a feeling of belonging and love. It opens up the person.

## teasing

Teasing teaches others that you are confident, unaffected by what they say, and that you look at things fun, comfortable with who you are, and can handle more than the friendship. 

Delivery is super important. It can't come from a negative place, or be harsh. Think of teasing your own little sister. Don't overdo it, it will show that you are just there to poke fun. It just leads in.

* Don't let it come from resentment. Just for your own entertainment.
* Don't tease too much. Stay balanced.

Guidelines:
    * Good smirk
    * Smize
    * open body language
    * kind intention
    * get one or two lines in before you get into convo
    * deliver with full confidence, comfort, and authority, as if you suddenly realized something about the person, kind of knee-jerk reaction
    * say it and own it, don't back down, even if the person doesn't get it
    * tweak lines so they are in line with you

Lines:
    * setting tone:
        * you and I are not going to get along
        * oh you are one of those..
        * don't say anything, you are cute, you are totally going to mess it up
        * you usually hang out at the library, don't you
        * you don't have to be nervous, it's cute
        * note to self, "do not meet her"
    * deeper into the conversation:
        * did you just come over here to flirt with me?
        * tell me what else you like about mess
        * do I look like a piece of meet to you?
        * you are hitting on a wrong guy, that guy over there looks better for you (point to some dorky guy)
        * you are falling in love with me right now, aren't you
        * stop undressing me with your eyes, it's making me uncomfortable
    * good rapport (you talk 25% of time):
        * what am I going to do with you? You are just making this stuff up as you go
        * I don't know what you are onto, but I want some of that
        * bartender, I think we need to cut her off
        * now, you are starting to really scare me
    * craby, uptight, protective barriers (probably had bad experience - goal to make person smile):
        * oh, we've got a grumpy smirf here
        * she's very hostile when she doesn't take a nap
        * I love when you talk mean to me
        * stop playing hard, I know I am way better at it
    * push-pull (you almost had me, but now it's over):
        * damn, I thought you were cool, but now I find you can't cook
        * I thought we got along, but it turns out we're gonna argue all the time

## Banter

## OSA - Observe Share and Ask

Observe:
    * what you see, something interests you

Share:
    * don't talk in simple facts
    * expand on the why
    * tell something about you
    * "I had been thinking about this muffin all weekend, it really helps me coming to work on Monday"

    * invite the other person into the convo

# fformula

Men and women think about flirting different.

Men think it is connected to sx content. Women just think about it as a playful banter.

Initiation > Escalation > Enfatuation.

"How to become a man women want" is the foundation, before this.
