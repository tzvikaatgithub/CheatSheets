[5G Spectrum and Frequencies: Everything You Need to Know](https://www.lifewire.com/5g-spectrum-frequencies-4579825)

Radio wave frequencies range: 3 kilohertz (kHz) - 300 gigahertz (GHz).
    * Microwave: frequencies < 1GHz.
    * Sub-6 GHz spectrum: frequencies 1-6 GHz.

Bands (portions of the spectrum of frequencies):
    * (ELF) extremely low frequency
    * (ULF) ultra low frequency
    * (LF) low frequency
        * 30Hz has wavelength of 10,000km
        * 30 kHz to 300 kHz are great for long-distance communications
        * low attenuation
        * usage: AM radio
    * (MF) medium frequency
    * (HF) high frequency
        * 300GHz frequency has 1mm wavelength
    * (UHF) ultra high frequency:
        * 300MHz-3GHz
        * Applications: TV, GPS, WiFi, Cordless phones, Bluetooth
    * (EHF) extremely high frequency
        * millimeter band: 1-10mm wavelength

Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency.

| Frequency  | High              | Low                   |
| =========  | ================= | ===================== |
| Speed      | Faster speeds     | Slower speeds         |

| Distance   | Shorter distances | Longer distances      |

| Distortion | Easy              | Hard                  |

Speed:
    * wavelength of a particular frequency used by a 5G tower directly impacts the speed and distance of transmissions.

Attenuation: gradual loss of power over distance.

Bandwidth:
    * measured by the delta between the highest and lowest frequency of the signal.
    * higher on the radio spectrum reaches higher bands, range of frequency is higher, throughput increases

Multi-layer spectrum:
    * C-band: 2–6 GHz for coverage and capacity.
    * Super Data Layer: Over 6 GHz (e.g., 24–29 GHz and 37–43 GHz) for high bandwidth areas.
    * Coverage Area: Below 2 GHz (like 700 MHz) for indoor and broader coverage areas.
