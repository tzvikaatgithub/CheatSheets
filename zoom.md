# Virtual Backgrounds

## Intro

Virtual backgrounds can be a powerful tool to spark different emotions and feelings in others during a video conference. Here are some examples of how different virtual backgrounds can be used to evoke specific emotions or feelings:

Calmness: A virtual background with a soothing natural landscape or an abstract image with cool colors and soft lines can create a calming atmosphere for the video conference.
Curiosity: A virtual background with an intriguing image or abstract design can make people wonder what it represents and why it was chosen, sparking curiosity and inspiring conversation.
Inspiration: A virtual background with an inspiring quote or image can motivate and uplift people, setting the tone for a productive and positive video conference.
Playfulness: A virtual background with a fun or quirky image can lighten the mood and make people feel more relaxed and playful, encouraging them to engage more openly and creatively.
Professionalism: A virtual background with a subtle and simple design can convey a professional and serious tone, setting the stage for a productive and efficient video conference.
Connection: A virtual background with an image that represents shared values or experiences can create a sense of connection and belonging, helping people feel more engaged and invested in the video conference.
Remember, the virtual background you choose can influence the mood and tone of the entire video conference, so it's important to choose one that aligns with your goals and intentions for the meeting.

## Spark Curiosity

When choosing a virtual background for a video conference, you can consider the following tips to create an image that relates to the topic of the meeting, but also invites curiosity and contemplation:

Symbolic imagery: Choose an image that is symbolic of the topic at hand, but not directly related. For example, if the topic is creativity, instead of a picture of paint brushes or art supplies, you might choose an image of a labyrinth or a tree that sparks thoughts about the creative process.
Abstract or impressionistic art: Using abstract or impressionistic art can be a great way to convey a mood or feeling related to the topic. The abstract image can also spark interest and invite interpretation.
Subtle references: You can also choose an image with a subtle reference to the topic, such as a piece of text, a small object, or a color scheme that relates to the topic. The reference doesn't need to be immediately noticeable, but can become a conversation starter.
Use natural imagery: Consider using a picture of a landscape or natural scenery that is vaguely related to the topic at hand. For example, if you are discussing teamwork, a picture of a group of animals working together in nature could spark curiosity and inspire discussion.
Think outside the box: Use your imagination and creativity to choose an image that is unexpected or unusual. This can pique people's interest and inspire them to ask questions and engage in conversation.
Remember, the goal is to choose a virtual background that sparks interest and encourages conversation, while still relating to the topic of the video conference.

Here are some questions you can ask yourself to come up with ideas for a virtual background that relates to the topic of the video conference but also sparks curiosity and contemplation:

What is the main theme or message of the video conference, and what images or symbols come to mind when I think of this theme or message?
Are there any metaphors or analogies that can be used to represent the topic of the video conference, and what images or symbols can be associated with these metaphors or analogies?

Remember, the goal is to create a virtual background that relates to the topic of the video conference, but also encourages curiosity and contemplation, so be creative and experiment with different ideas until you find one that works best for you
