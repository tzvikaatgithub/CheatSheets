COMPARING PREVIOUS OUTPUT

Here we will detect host changes on a network.

We must save results of each scan to a file and then compare the latest scan to a previous result.

When you find a device that has had a TCP port opened or closed, you can investigate further to determine whether it was an authorized change or a sign of malicions activity.
