<h2>A Beginner's Guide To Firewalling with pf</h2>
</center>
<p>This guide is written for the person very new to firewalling.
Please realize that the sample firewall we build should not be
considered appropriate for actual use. I just try to cover a few
basics, that took me awhile to grasp from the better known (and
more detailed) documentation referenced below</p>
<p>It's my hope that this guide will not only get you started, but
give you enough of a grasp of using pf so that you will then be
able to go to those more advanced guides and perfect your
firewalling skills.</p>
<p>The pf packet filter was developed for OpenBSD but is now
included in FreeBSD, which is where I've used it. Having it run at
boot and the like is covered in the various documents, however I'll
quickly run through the steps for FreeBSD.</p>
<p>First one adds to /etc/rc.conf</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pf_enable="YES"
pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"
pflog_enable="YES"
pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This will start the pf filter at boot. We'll cover starting it
while running after we put in some rules.</p>
<h4>A few precautions</h4>
While experimenting with rules on a remote machine, please be
careful. Many people have shut themselves out of a remote machine.
One simple solution is to open a session in <a href="screentmux.html">
screen or tmux</a> on the machine you're working on.  In that session, as
root, run 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sleep 120; pfctl -d
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
which will disable pf after 2 minutes. 
Another, slightly more involved solution is to add a quick cronjob to turn off pf, so
that if you do make this mistake, you can get back into the box
shortly. Don't do this now, wait till we've made some rules, but
let's make a few preparations. 
Make a quick change to
/usr/local/etc/sudoers (in FreeBSD, it may be elsewhere on other
operating systems.)
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
visudo -f /usr/local/etc/sudoers
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If your user name is john, then add a line (below any other
lines giving you less privileges--sudo processes the sudoers file
from top to bottom)</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
john    ALL= NOPASSWD: /sbin/pfctl
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now we edit the crontab.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
crontab -e
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Then, in your crontab add</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
*/2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/sudo /sbin/pfctl -d
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
This has the same effect, to stop pf after 2 minutes.  (Change the
time as desired.)
<p>I dislike the NOPASSWD option, as it makes it easier to make
serious mistakes--however, when I'm testing a bunch of pf rules, I
usually put it in there as I'm constantly using pfctl. When done,
and the ruleset works, I remove the NOPASSWD part.</p>
<p>Ok, now that we've ensured we'll be able to get back in the box,
let's create an /etc/pf.conf file. In FreeBSD, the file already
exists. What I usually do is start in my home directory, create the
rules, and then test them, loading them with sudo. Then, when it's
working the way I want it to work, I backup the default pf.conf and
copy it over.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
mv /etc/pf.conf /etc/pf.conf.bak
cp pf.conf /etc
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(As we haven't yet created the file, don't do it yet) :).</p>
<h4>A simple ruleset</h4>
In your home directory, open up your favorite text editor and
create a file called pf.conf to start setting your rules. We start
with some macros. Macros are similar to variables in programming. A
brief example
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 80 22 }"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We've created a macro. Later, when we make rules, rather than
having to make one rule for port 80 and a second for port 22 we can
simply do something like</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass out proto tcp to port $tcp_pass
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(Note that you need the $ in front of the macro's name.)</p>

<p>Then, if we decide we want to add port 123, the Network Time
Protocol, rather than write a new rule, we can simply add 123 to
our macro. We can also realize we forgot to allow it to get email
so we'll add all three, pop3 to get email, smtp to send it and ntp
to connect to time servers.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass= "{ 80 22 25 110 123 }"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The pf filter will read the rules we create from top to bottom.
So, we start with a rule to block everything</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
block all
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This keeps the box pretty secure, but we won't be able to do
anything. So, in order to access web pages, allow the Network Time
Protocol to connect to a time server and to ssh to an outside
machine, we can use the macro we defined. Our pf.conf looks like
this.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 80 22 25 110 123 }"
block all
pass out on fxp0 proto tcp to any port $tcp_pass keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Let's look at what we've done so far. First, we defined a macro.
We used port numbers. While one can mix and match if they want, for
clarity's sake, we try to use the same pattern for all ports. We
can also put in commas if we want or the protocol name if it's
defined in /etc/services. So, that macro could actually read</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 80 ssh, ntp smtp 110}"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>and still work. However, one should strive for consistancy.</p>

My personal habit is to have one white space between left bracket and
first port and another space between the last port listed and the white
bracket.  (However, that white space, as shown in the example above, is
also optional--that is one can do { 80 or {80 and they will both work. 
Also, keeping in them in numerical order helps you remember
what you're doing.  So, let's clean up the above example a little bit.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass= "{ 22 25 80 110 123 }"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>



<p>You can only use a name if the port is defined in /etc/services.
For instance, if you decide to set ssh to only accept connections
on port 1222, you would have to put 1222 in that macro, NOT ssh.
Port 1222 is defined in /etc/services as nerv, the SNI R&amp;D
network, so if you check your rules with pfctl, it'll show that you
have a rule to pass out to nerv. To avoid confusion, if you're
going to use a non-standard port, use something that isn't listed
in /etc/services.</p>
<p>You can also specify a range of ports with a colon. For
instance, if I wanted to add samba, which uses ports 137, 138 and
139, I could have added 137:139.</p>
<p>Next, we block everything as our default. Now, we have to add
rules to let things through. Remember, pf processes rules from top
to bottom.</p>
<p>So, we are allowing out web traffic, ssh connections, sending
mail, getting mail with pop3, and we're able to contact time
servers.</p>
<p>So, we start with the action, pass. We're passing, not blocking.
The order of syntax is important. I'm just giving the basic options
here, again, this article can be considered a prep for more
advanced tutorials.</p>
<p>pass out means we're allowing things out, not necessarily in.
The next part, on fxp0 refers to the interface--in this case, a
network card that in FreeBSD parlance is called fxp0. (An Intel
card).</p>
<p>The to any part means that we're allowing it to go anywhere.
Next, we specify the ports we're talking about--here we use our
macro, tcp_pass, meaning we're allowing to the ports mentioned
above.</p>
<p>The keep state part can be important. It means that once we've
established the connection, pf is going to keep track of it, so the
answer from, for example, a web page, doesn't have to go through
checking each rule, but can just be opened. The same with pop3. One
uses pop3 to contact a pop3 server (hrrm, obviously), and the
server answers. As we have the keep state keywords, the server's
answer can go right through once the connection is established.</p>
<p>Many of these are optional. For example, if we write pass on
fxp0 rather than pass out on fxp0, then traffic will be allowed in
both directions, in and out.</p>
<p>If you look through /etc/services, you'll see that some things,
such as ipp, port 631 used with CUPS, use both tcp and udp. To deal
with such things, we could insert another macro</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>

udp_pass = "{ 631 }"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>We might find that sending email isn't working properly.
Checking /etc/services we find that smtp can use udp.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
grep smtp /etc/services
smtp             25/tcp    mail         #Simple Mail Transfer
smtp             25/udp    mail         #Simple Mail Transfer
smtps           465/tcp    #smtp protocol over TLS/SSL (was ssmtp)
smtps           465/udp    #smtp protocol over TLS/SSL (was ssmtp)
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>However, with our new macro, this is simple--we simply add it to
udp_pass</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
udp_pass = "{ 110 631 }"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now, let's add the udp_pass macro to our ruleset</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 22 25 80 110 123 }"
udp_pass = "{ 110 631 }"
block all
pass out on fxp0 proto tcp to any port $tcp_pass keep state
pass out on fxp0 proto udp to any port $udp_pass keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>However, we find CUPS isn't working. A quick grep of ipp in
/etc/services shows that it also uses tcp. So, we add 631 to our
list of ports in the tcp_pass macro. Now we have</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 22 25 80 110 123 631 }"
udp_pass = "{ 110 631 }"
block all
pass out on fxp0 proto tcp to any port $tcp_pass keep state
pass out on fxp0 proto udp to any port $udp_pass keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The same holds true for any other ports that you've forgotten.
For instance, these rules don't allow DNS, port 53. We grep domain
in /etc/services, and see that it uses both tcp and udp so we add
53 to both macros</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcp_pass = "{ 22 25 53 80 110 123 631 }"
udp_pass = "{ 53 110 631 }"
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h4>Using the quick keyword</h4>
Packets going in and out are matched against an entire ruleset
before being passed or blocked. Sometimes, you want to speed things
up and either quickly block or quickly pass a package.
<p>In such cases, you can use the quick keyword. If a packet
matches something in that line, it stops going through the rules
and processes the packet. For example, let's say that you have a
web server on your LAN behind a firewall, and you are sure that all
requests for port 80 are coming from your internal network, so you
want to quickly pass them through. (I can't see that being true in
real life, but this is for an example of using quick).</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass in quick on fxp0 proto tcp to any port 80 keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Put that above the other rules, right after the macro
definitions. Now, requests coming in for the LAN webserver will be
passed right though (note that in this case it was pass in) without
being matched against the rest of the ruleset.</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
Tables are useful and fast. They are used to hold a group of
addresses. For instance, suppose you want to allow everything in
from your local networks, 192.168.8.0 and 192.168.9.0
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
table &lt;local&gt; { 192.168.8.0/24, 192.168.9.0/24 }
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Insert that line above your rules. Now, to allow everything from
those two networks (and we'll make use of the quick keyword as
well) add a rule. Since we're using quick we want this rule towards
the top. If it was at the end, there's no point in using the quick
keyword, for the packets would have already been matched against
every rule above this one</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass in quick from &lt;local&gt; to any keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
Sometimes, you might have mistyped something, so it's always good to
check your tables.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t local -T show
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
will show you the contents of your table.  
Note that if you edit your pf.conf, adding a table, and then simply
pfctl -d and -e, to disable and re-enable pf, the table rules may not be
applied.  The way to do it is
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t local -Tl -f /etc/pf.conf
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The -t is for the table name, in this case, local.  The -T is used to
give various commands.  In this case, we are using l for
load.  That is a lower case letter L, not the numeral one. The -f is for
file, in this case, /etc/pf.conf where we have added the table. <p>
We can use pfctl for various useful table commands.  We've already
mentioned the show command. 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t mytable -T show
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
will show you the current working contents of a table called mytable.
If you keep mytable in a static file, for example, /etc/pf.mytable, and
edit the file, the way to get pf to use it is
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t mytable -T replace -f pf.mytable <img src="1.png">
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<img src="1.png">When using a text file, create a line in pf.conf like
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
table &lt;mytable&gt; persist file "/etc/pf.mytable"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In this case, it is replacing whatever the former contents of mytable were
with the latest contents of mytable.<p>
Tables can be added and deleted on the fly, see the links at the end of
this article for more details.  To add or delete an address to a table on
the fly, one can use, to add the address 192.168.1.115 to a table called
mytable
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t mytable -T add 192.168.1.115
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To remove the address 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t mytable -T delete 192.168.1.115
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This all takes effect immediately.  As mentioned above, you can confirm that the desired
address has been added or deleted with 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -t mytable -T show
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Another popular use of tables is to block bruteforce attacks.  
This can go directly into pf.conf 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
table &lt;bruteforce&gt;
block in quick from &ltbruteforce&gt;
pass in inet proto tcp from any to any port ssh \
flags S/SA keep state \
(max-src-conn 10 max-src-conn-rate 10/30, \
overload &lt;bruteforce&gt; flush global)
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This will block any IP trying to connect more than 10 times in 30 seconds.
You may want much higher numbers, depending upon circumstances. In the <a
href="https://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/bruteforce.html">Peter Hansteen
article</a> that showed me this, he has a max-src-conn at 100 and
max-src-conn-rate at 15/5.<p>

<h4>Anchors</h4>
Like tables, anchors can be added on the fly.  However, tables are more
for addresses and anchors are for rules.  They can be handy while
testing rulesets.<p>
For example, I have an anchor to allow me to use ftp.
I create a file that reads
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass out proto tcp from any to port 21 keep state
pass out proto tcp from any to port > 1023 keep state
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
I save it as /etc/ftp-anchor and at end of my /etc/pf.conf file put
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
anchor ftpanchor
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Now, I want to grab something from ftp.FreeBSD.org. 
I load the anchor ruleset.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -a ftpanchor -f /etc/ftp-anchor
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
I can check that the rules are loaded.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -a ftpanchor -s rules
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The -a is for anchor.  In the first command the -f was for the file that
we are using.  The second command uses -s as in show to show the rules.
I should get a reponse to that command showing the anchor ruleset of
passing out proto tcp on ports 21 and everything above port 1023<p>
Now I do whatever I had to do.  I want to remove those rules.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -a ftpanchor -F rules
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Doing the pfctl -a ftpanchor -s rules should now give me no response.  My
pf ruleset is back to normal.  <p>
One can edit the anchor ruleset and reload and unload it at will without
having to restart pf or reload the entire pf.conf ruleset.  It's handy
for testing various rules.  For example, perhaps I also need to allow
out udp to do what I want.  Rather than adding a line to pf.conf and
reloading the entire ruleset, I can edit /etc/ftp-anchor, add a line
to allow out udp, then reload the anchor with pfctl -a -f
/etc/ftp-anchor again.  Once again, when finished, I can flush the
anchor rules and my pf ruleset is back to normal.
(One doesn't need udp for ftp, but this is for example.)
<p>
If you think you will usually want to have the anchor in place, and only
unload it on rare occasions, you would add, below the anchor line
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
load anchor ftpanchor from "/etc/ftp-anchor"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Now, the anchor will load whenever pf starts.  
<p>
Anchors are quite flexible.  The above gives very simple examples.  The
more detailed guides listed at the end of this article go into greater
detail.
  
<p>

<h4>The pfctl command</h4>
We've already mentioned the pfctl command. It does a variety of
things--as you can guess from its name, it controls pf. 
It's used to
enable, disable, reload and flush rulesets as well as give status.
I'l just cover a few of the main uses here, check the man page. You
might remember the cronjob we made will simply disable the packet
filter. That's a simple -d flag
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo pfctl -d
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
To test the syntax of rules without loading them we can use -n 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -n -v -f /etc/pf.conf
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The -v is for verbose and the -f for the file.
<p>To put the packet filter we've created into effect, assuming you
are user john and you've created it in your home directory, as
john</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo pfctl -ef pf.conf
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The -f stands for file. Say we've checked it out and we don't
like it so we want to go back to our default rules, in /etc/</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
It used to be pfctl -Rf /etc/pf.conf but (and last I looked the man page
doesn't mention that) if you do so you'll get a message that you must
enable table loading for optimization.  So, just use pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

<p>There are a variety of uses for pfctl. Doing pfctl -s info gives
you a quick look at what's going on. Doing pfctl -vs rules shows
you your rules and what's happening, for example</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass out proto tcp from any to any port = http keep state
  [ Evaluations: 96        Packets: 906       Bytes: 496407      States: 0     ]
pass out proto tcp from any to any port = pop3 keep state
  [ Evaluations: 96        Packets: 514       Bytes: 71260       States: 0     ]
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The man page gives a complete list.</p>
<p>Now it's time to test this. It's early morning, and I'm not
thinking that clearly. Hopefully, however, I've remembered to add
myself to sudoers as being able to run pfctl without a password and
remember to quickly set up the cronjob so that if I make a mistake,
pf will be disabled shortly. (VERY necessary if you're testing this
on a machine to which you don't have physical access). So, I put
these rules which I've saved into a file pf.conf in my home
directory into operation.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo pfctl -ef pf.conf
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I find that I've locked myself out of the box. Oops. I forgot to
allow ssh connections in, and the connection that I was using has
just been blocked.</p>
<p>So, I wait a few minutes for the crontab to disable pf and log
back into the remote machine. This time, I remember to add a
rule</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass in proto tcp to port 22 keep state
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now, these rules seem to be working. So, I copy them over to
/etc/pf.conf.</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
sudo cp pf.conf /etc/
sudo pftcl -f /etc/pf.conf
sudo pftcl -s rules
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Listing the rules will show me that it's doing what I want to
do.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I remove the cronjob. If you're going to be
experimenting with your rules frequently, and will be needing it
again, just do crontab -e and comment the line out with a #.</p>
<h4>A few odds and ends</h4>
Using ftp with pf can be problematic. For detailed explanations of
workarounds, see the <a href="#frequently">more detailed guides</a>
referenced at the end of this article. In a nutshell, you have to
redirect them to a proxy. The only trick that I don't believe
is mentioned in the more detailed guides is that it has to go above
your filtering rules. Otherwise, you'll get an error message that
rules must be in order options, normalization, etc.<p>
Most of what is covered in the more advanced guides seems to be aimed at
having an ftp server.  To simply use an ftp client from your workstation, 
rather than use the rdr (for redirect) rules, you might simply 
use an anchor to allow out proto tcp while using ftp.  I gave an example
in the section about anchors.


<p>There is also the scrub keyword. Again, while this is more fully
explained in the references <a href="#frequently">below</a> in a
nutshell it normalizes fragmented packets. The usual line is</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
scrub in all
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This rule must also go above the filtering rules (and above the
rdr to redirect ftp if you use it.) It is the "normalization"
referred to in that error message. At the top of the ruleset you
define your macros, tables and the like. Then would come the scrub
rule, then the rdr rule, then your filtering rules (the group that
in our example begins with block all). Using the scrub keyword can
help protect against certain kinds of attacks, and it's a good line
to have.</p>
<p>In FreeBSD, one of the older versions, (5.something or perhaps 6.0)
you have to add the pf module to your kernel.  In later versions, it's
not necessary, it will load the module if listed in /etc/rc.conf.
Check /usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES to see the various options, but 
I just had</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
device          pf
device          pflog
device          pfsync
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I also have</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
options         ALTQ
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>in my kernel. Although I don't make use of queuing, otherwise,
one gets a warning every time they reload their pf rules that ALTQ
isn't enabled in the kernel.</p>
(I'm not sure if this is still needed or not, all the boxes I have still
have it in their custom kernels and I've never removed it.)<p>
<p>If you use the module, it assumes the presence of device bpf,
INET and INET6 in the kernel. (See the <a href=
"http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/firewalls-pf.html">
handbook page</a> on pf.)</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
Logging is done by adding the log keyword to a rule. First, in
/etc/rc.conf, you should have the lines
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pflog_enable="YES"
pflog_logfile="/var/log/pf.log"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The log keyword comes after pass or block in or out.  For example, we have a rule
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass out proto tcp from any to port 21 keep state
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To log it, we would change that line to read
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pass out log proto tcp from any to port 21 keep state
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
You may have to run the command touch /var/log/pf.log, or it may be
automatically created.   After this is done, restart pf
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
pfctl -f /etc/pf.rules
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
It isn't in readable form, you have to use tcpdump
to read it. 
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pf.log
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To read it in realtime
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<h3>Nat and redirection</h3>
It's pretty easy to use pf for NAT and redirection.  One common use I've
seen is with a FreeBSD jail server, cloning its lo interface to give said
interface a private range of addresses.  Then use pf to redirect queries on
say, 80 (and/or 443) to that address.  
First we clone the interface. In the 
system's /etc/rc.conf we put
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
cloned_interfaces=lo1"
ipv4_addrs_lo1="192.168.1.1-9/29"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
(That is a lower case L, lowercase letter O, and the numeral one, as in loopback one.)
That gives a range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9.  To do this on the fly,
the commands are
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
ifconfig lo1 create
ifconfig lo1 inet 192.168.1.1/29 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
I haven't needed this often enough to figure out the syntax of creating
multiple lo1 addresses with ifconfig.  If I were doing it on the fly, I
would set up rc.conf as mentioned, but use an alias on the command line,
e.g.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
ifconfig lo1 alias 192.168.1.2/29. 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
(You could also use aliases in /etc/rc.conf instead of the syntax I
have--as the saying goes, in Unix there's always more than one way to do
something with a corollary that someone thinks your way is stupid, but I
digress.)<p>

We'll assume you have a public address of 5.6.7.8 and you will
redirect inquiries to your webserver running on cloned lo1 interface
192.168.1.1.  Our public network interface will be bce0.  We'll assume the
reader has built a jail to host their web server.  I have a page on <a
href="freebsdjail.html"> jails</a> for readers looking to get started with
them. <p>
Now we edit /etc/pf.conf. At the top, we define macros.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
IP_PUB="5.6.7.8"
NETJAIL="192.168.1.1"
WEBPORT="{ 80, 443 }"

scrub in all
nat pass on bce0 proto tcp from $NETJAIL to any -> $IP_PUB
nat pass on bce0 proto udp from $NETJAIL to any -> $IP_PUB  <img src="1.png">
rdr pass on bce0 proto tcp from any to $IP_PUB port $WEBPORT -> $NETJAIL
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<img src="1.png"> These two lines allow things from the jail to go out through the
public interface, in case that wasn't clear. It may not even be
necessary.  In some cases, you may need tcp but not udp. The user can adapt
it to their needs.
<p>
These should all be added above rules, otherwise, one gets an error that
rules must be in order; options, normalization, queueing, translation,
filtering. <p>

We can add other jails.  For example, if we did give lo1 a range of
addresses, we might have 192.168.1.2 be a jail running MySQL.  
Create a couple of new macros.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
SQLJAIL="192.168.1.2"
SQLPORT="{ 3306 }"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Then add  
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
rdr pass on bce0 proto tcp from any to $IP_PUB port $SQLPORT -> $SQLJAIL
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
(Or, as we expect 3306 to be the only port used, don't bother making a
macro for  it, just have the rule read  from any to $IP_PUB port 3306.  As
long as the reader understands the syntax, they can do adapt it to their
needs.) 


<p>This page is only meant to be an introduction. However, if
you've understood these simple rulesets, you're probably ready to
look at the more sophisticated tutorials. The two that I use most
<a name="frequently" id="frequently">frequently</a> are the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html">OpenBSD PF
User's Guide</a> and <a href=
"http://rlworkman.net/howtos/OpenBSD_pf_guide.html">Peter N.M.
Hansteen's tutorial</a> Feel free to <a href=
"mailto:scottro11@gmail.com">email me</a> if you detect any
glaring errors. I am no expert on pf, but hope that this brief
introduction will make it easier for the novice to grasp its basic
concepts.</p>
There have been various, sometimes significant, divergence in OpenBSD's and
FreeBSD's pf syntax, so the more recent OpenBSD guides may not work as
expected in FreeBSD.  To get the older OpenBSD faqs, you can use cvs.
For the 4.1 version use
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs1.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -D "May 2, 2007" www/faq/pf
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To get the 4.5 version
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E8E8E8">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs1.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -D "May 2, 2009" www/faq/pf
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
